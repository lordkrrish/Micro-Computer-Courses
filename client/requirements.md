## Packages
framer-motion | Animations for the tech feel (matrix effects, fade-ins)
lucide-react | Icons for the courses and contact info

## Notes
Using a dark theme with a tech-inspired background GIF as requested.
Fonts: 'Share Tech Mono' for headers (tech feel) and 'Inter' for readability.
Courses are static for now based on the prompt, but I'll set up the structure to fetch from API if available.
